Prerender S3 Cache plugin
===========================

This is a plugin meant to be used with your Prerender server to cache responses in Amazon S3.

Run this from within your Prerender server directory:

```bash
$ npm install prerender-aws-s3-cache --save
```
##### server.js
```js
const prerender = require('prerender');
const server = prerender();

server.use(require('prerender-aws-s3-cache'))

server.start();
```
##### Test it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/render?url=https://www.example.com/
```
A `GET` request will check S3 for a cached copy. If a cached copy is found, it will return that. Otherwise, it will make the request to your server and then persist the HTML to the S3 cache.

A `POST` request will skip the S3 cache. It will make a request to your server and then persist the HTML to the S3 cache. The `POST` is meant to update the cache.

You'll need to sign up with Amazon Web Services and export these 3 environment variables.

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws access key>
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws secret access key>
$ export S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name>
```

Warning! Your keys should be kept private and you'll be charged for all files uploaded to S3.

> If Prerender is hosted on a EC2 instance, you can also take advantage of [IAM instance roles](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/06/iam-roles-for-ec2-instances-simplified-secure-access-to-aws-service-apis-from-ec2.html)
so that you don't need to export your AWS credentials.

> You can also export the S3_PREFIX_KEY variable so that the key (which is by default the complete requested URL) is
prefixed. This is useful if you want to organize the snapshots in the same bucket.

## Options

#### REGION
By default, s3HtmlCache works with the US Standard region (East), if your bucket is localized in another region you can config it with an environment variable : `AWS_REGION`.

```
$ export AWS_REGION=<region name>
```

For example :

```
$ export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
```

#### S3_PREFIX_KEY
Allows you to prefix your keys if you want all of your snapshots to live in a specific folder inside your S3 bucket

`export S3_PREFIX_KEY=prerender`

default: none

#### S3_CACHE_FRESHNESS
Allows to set how long a cached copy of the html in s3 is considered fresh before overwriting with a new version. Value should be unix epoch time in milliseconds.

`export S3_CACHE_FRESHNESS=<value>`

default: 604800000 (7 days)
